# Git-kit (personal toolkit)
I saw a post about deleting branches of git that is written by `rust`. I think the idea is awesome.
Because I have many projects which have so many old branches.
I don't want to delete manually and I want to learn `Golang` too.
Feel free to create the issue if you want to add a feature.

### Run
```
go run main.go
```

### Build
```
go build
```

and run after build
```
./git-kit
```

### TODO:

- Use goroutine for deleting
- Add delete branch by filter
- Refactor message
- Refactor structure, codebase, ...
